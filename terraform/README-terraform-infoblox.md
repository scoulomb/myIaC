# Terraform 

## Terraform Infoblox plugin

We had done something similar with Ansible in [myDNS](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/tree/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/4-Ansible-API).

Examples are given here:
- https://github.com/infobloxopen/terraform-provider-infoblox/tree/master/examples/azurerm (it is not Azure DNS but Infoblox deployed on Azure)
- https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/infoblox/r/a_record.html

We will create a A record and CName record with Terraform (note HostRecord creation seems not possible with Terraform).

### Configure the provider

To start the doc given on Terraform website for Terraform provider here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/infoblox/index.html

is not accurate, it should not be:

````shell script
provider "infoblox"{
INFOBLOX_USERNAME=infoblox
INFOBLOX_SERVER=10.0.0.1
INFOBLOX_PASSWORD=infoblox
}
````

but 

````shell script
provider "infoblox" {
username="admin"
server="x.y.z.t" # DNS server DNS name or IP address (both tested ok), be careful to space
password="infoblox"
wapi_version=2.5 # change version to 2.5 and do not use default to 2.7 (as my Infoblox instance is a 2.5)
}
````

To find the issue, I had to check Infoblox plugin code [here](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-infoblox/blob/328f438127673823fc574c7c9dfe75c82978b8bd/infoblox/provider.go).
Otherwise it will prompt for username, server and password.

I fixed it here: https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-infoblox/pull/12

I also added `wapi_version`

Otherwise we have the following error:

```shell script
[root@archlinux infoblox]# terraform apply
[...]
Error: WAPI request error: 400('400 Bad Request')
Contents:
Version 2.7 not supported


  on <input-prompt> line 1:
  (source code not available)

````

To find the issue, I had to check Infoblox plugin code [here](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-infoblox/blob/328f438127673823fc574c7c9dfe75c82978b8bd/infoblox/provider.go).


Similarly running A record creation with 2.7 lead same error:
https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md#post-a
```shell script
curl -k -H "Authorization: Basic $(cat ~/admin-credentials | base64)" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -X GET \
       "https://$API_ENDPOINT/wapi/v2.7/record:a?name=test-infoblox-api-a1.test.loc
```
Output is 

````shell script
Version 2.7 not supported
````


To fix this we set `wapi_version=2.5`


### Configure NIOS

Then when creating a record we had error like 

````shell script
Error: Error creating CNAME Record : WAPI request error: 400('400 Bad Request')
Contents:
{ "Error": "AdmConProtoError: Unknown extensible attribute: VM Name",
  "code": "Client.Ibap.Proto",
  "text": "Unknown extensible attribute: VM Name"
}


  on main.tf line 13, in resource "infoblox_cname_record" "demo_cname":
  13: resource "infoblox_cname_record" "demo_cname"{

````

The reason of this is that I am not using a CNA (Cloud Network Automation) edition of Infoblox.
So we shoud add EA (extensible attributes) with infoblox UI.
Gui is avaialble at http://$API_SERVER/ui.

From there add EA wiht following steps.

1. Navigate to Administration -> Extensible Attributes in your Infoblox Grid Manager GUI.
2. Click on the + (Add) button.
3. Enter the name for the EA, as displayed in bold in the list above.
4. Set the Type dropdown menu to the required setting (refer to the list above).
5. Optional: Add a comment.
6. Click on the small arrow next to Save & Close and select Save & New to add additional EAâ€™s, or click on Save & Close if don

Here are EA to add:

````shell script
If CNA licenses not present following default EA's should be added in NIOS side.
VM Name :: String Type
VM ID :: String Type
Tenant ID :: String Type
CMP Type :: String Type
Cloud API Owned :: List Type
Network Name :: String Type
````

We can refer to:
- https://github.com/infobloxopen/terraform-provider-infoblox/issues/62
- https://vmguru.com/2017/07/infoblox-vrealize-automation-infoblox-nios-setup/


Note we need to add the EA as the plugin forces us to send this attributes.

### And test the configuration

#### Creation

````shell script
cd /home/vagrant/dev/myIaC/terraform/infoblox
terraform init 
terraform apply
````

Output is 

````shell script
[vagrant@archlinux infoblox]$ terraform apply

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # infoblox_a_record.demo_record will be created
  + resource "infoblox_a_record" "demo_record" {
      + cidr              = "10.0.0.0/24"

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

````

We can now even retrieve those records as made here in [myDNS repo](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md#post-a)

```shell script

And even with nslookup

````shell script

#### Destroy

And we delete the ressouce 

```shell script
[vagrant@archlinux infoblox]$ terraform destroy

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # infoblox_a_record.demo_record will be destroyed
  - resource "infoblox_a_record" "demo_record" {
      - cidr              = "10.0.0.0/24" -> null

      - zone      = "test.loc" -> null
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

infoblox_cname_record.demo_cname: Destroying... [id=record:cname/<uid-1>:demo1.test.loc/default]

Note if changing value terraform will do the diff but plugin does not support it and it leads to an error.


### Comment on resource



#### CNAME record

```shell script
resource "infoblox_cname_record" "demo_cname"{
  canonical="demo.scoulomb.com"
  zone="test.loc"
  alias="demo1"
  tenant_id="test"
}
```

alias is not like alias host record.
It will create alias + zone pointing to canonical.


#### A record

````shell script
resource "infoblox_a_record" "demo_record" {
  vm_name="scoulomb-terraform"
  zone="test.loc"
  dns_view="default"
  ip_addr="42.42.42.42" //use the ip address used in IP allocation
  cidr="10.0.0.0/24"
  tenant_id="dummy"
  network_view_name="dummy"
}
````

vm_name is relative DNS name and we have a zone concept which we do not have in original API.
Cf:
- https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/4-Analysis/1-comparison-table.md
- https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md

Here it creates A record where matching FQDN is : (vm_name+zone)

##### Unused fields

##### Tests

The tenant_id, cidr and network view name are accepted because I added [EA in NIOS](#Configure-NIOS).
But not used IMO.
I think Cloud Edition is using it for extra validation.
Here we used default view attached to default network.

This matches our understanding of the datamodel made here:
https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md#infoblox-network-view-and-view-and-zone-creation

To prove it I will use:
- `default.$networkName` view attached to `$networkName` network view (at network view creation).

Instead of 

- `Default` view is attached to `default` network view.

This was described [myDNS, Infoblox API overview](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md#api-impact-and-wrapup)

And will show an invalid network name is accepted.


As done in [myDNS, Infoblox API overview](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md#api-impact-and-wrapup)

<!--
I had updated it for the occasion
-->

I will create a network:


````shell script
sudo pacman -S jq
export API_ENDPOINT="dns_server_dns_name" # IP or FQDN to DNS
export USERNAME="admin"
export PASSWORD="infoblox"

curl -k -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "https://$API_ENDPOINT/wapi/v2.5/networkview?_return_fields%2B=name&_return_as_object=1" -d '{"name":

export network_view_id=$(curl -k -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD \

echo $network_view_id

````

This created the view:

````shell script
curl -k -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -H 'content-type: application/json' -X GET https://$API_ENDPOINT/wapi/v2.5/view | grep -C 2 "scoulomb-nw"
````

        "is_default": false,
        "name": "default.scoulomb-nw"
    }
]
````

I will also need to create a `scoulomb.loc` zone in that view:

````shell script
curl -k -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "https://$API_ENDPOINT/wapi/v2.5/zone_auth?_return_fields%2B=fqdn,network_view&_return_as_object=1" -d \

        -X GET \
        "https://$API_ENDPOINT/wapi/v2.5/zone_auth?fqdn=scoulomb.loc&view=default.scoulomb-nw")
# if using test.loc, add the view in the query!
echo $find_zone_res
export view_scoulomb_loc=$(echo $find_zone_res | jq .[0]._ref |  tr -d '"')
echo $view_scoulomb_loc

````


In my Terraform file, in `view_test` folder.
I will use that view but a dummyNetworkName instead of `scoulomb-nw` which would have been correct.

I can not show the `network-view` field here unlike Host `Unknown argument/field: 'network_view'"`
But we know from [myDNS](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/3-DNS-solution-providers/1-Infoblox/1-Infoblox-API-overview.md#api-impact-and-wrapup).
> - default.$networkName view is attached to $networkName network view (at network view creation).
> - A DNS view can be in one network view only, but a network view can have multiple DNS views.

As a consequence dummy value has not been taken into account. CQFD.
